# hCRNG - Deprecated Software
The hcRNG package is deprecated software. Please us the [rocRAND](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/rocRAND) instead.

## A. Introduction: ##

The hcRNG library is an implementation of uniform random number generators targetting the AMD heterogenous hardware via HCC compiler runtime. The computational resources of underlying AMD heterogenous compute gets exposed and exploited through the HCC C++ frontend. Refer [here](https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/hcc) for more details on HCC compiler.

The following list enumerates the current set of RNG generators that are supported so far.

1. MRG31k3p
2. MRG32k3a
3. LFSR113
4. Philox-4x32-10

To know more, go through the [Documentation](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/hcRNG/wiki)

## B. Key Features ##

* Support for 4 commonly used uniform random number generators.
* Single and Double precision.
* Multiple streams, created on the host and generates random numbers either on the host or on computing devices.
